BlueCove Linux module

* Requirements

    * BlueCove library of the same mojor version

    * Package bluez-libs 3.7 or later should be installed on your system

    * We linked JNI library with <libbluetooth.so> (Not libbluetooth.so.3 or libbluetooth.so.2) to be able to use same build with Bluez Version 3 and Version 4

        * You need package/rpm that creates a link libbluetooth.so to already installed libbluetooth.so.3 or libbluetooth.so.2

        * <libbluetooth-dev> on Ubuntu

        * <bluez-libs-devel> on Fedora

        * <bluez-devel> on openSUSE

    * To change Discoverable mode of the device you should be root

    * On 64-bit Linux platform 64-bit java should be used


* Standard Linux Distribution that can be used with binary BlueCove distribution

    * Ubuntu 7.04 feisty (bluez 3.8) and later

    * OpenSUSE 10.2 (bluez-libs-3.7) and later

    * Fedora Core 6 (bluez-libs-3.7) and later

    * {{{http://www.cyrius.com/debian/nslu2/}Debian 4.0r3 ARM on the Linksys NSLU2}} (bluez-libs-3.7)

    * This is not complete list! For other Linux distributions you may need to compile it yourself using maven or ant.


* Compile it yourself

    You may build BlueCove JNI library on your system using ant or maven. See developer-read-me.txt in sources folder for details.

* Configuration options

    System properties:

        * `bluecove.deviceID=1` bluecove supports multiple local devices, this will force it to select second one.

        * `bluecove.deviceID=hci1` this will force BlueCove to select second adapter.

        * `bluecove.deviceAddress=btaddr` select local devices by Bluetooth address

* Documentation

    API-Documentation for BlueCove {{{../bluecove/apidocs/index.html}Java docs}}. For application it is not recommended to use any classes or API other than defined in JSR-82.

    API that enables the use of Multiple Adapters and Bluetooth Stacks in parallel in the same JVM is BlueCove specific, documentation can be found {{{../bluecove/apidocs/com/intel/bluetooth/BlueCoveImpl.html#useThreadLocalBluetoothStack()}here}}.

    JSR-82 extension <<<bluecovepsm>>> enables the use of specific PSM channel in L2CAP service. <<<btl2cap://localhost;name=...;bluecovepsm=1007>>>
