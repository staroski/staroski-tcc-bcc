BlueCove JSR-82 Emulator module

   bluecove-emu is additional module for BlueCove to simulate Bluetooth stack.

   bluecove-emu is a pure Java implementation of JSR-82 without Bluetooth hardware. Fully tested using TCK {{{../tck/}JSR-82 TCK test results}}

   bluecove-emu requires Java 5 Standard Edition and uses RMI for interprocess communication.

   N.B. This is experimental module and have no monitoring GUI. Another module bluecove-emu-gui is in developement. {{{http://groups.google.com/group/bluecove-developers}Help us make it}}.

   The diagram below shows the architecture used by this module

* Usage

 Start local bluetooth air simulator server

---
java -cp bluecove-#version#.jar;bluecove-emu-#version#.jar com.intel.bluetooth.emu.EmuServer
---

 Start jsr-82 application that connects to air simulator server

---
java -Dbluecove.stack=emulator -cp bluecove-#version#.jar;bluecove-emu-#version#.jar;yourApp.jar org.your.app.Main
---

 Start MIDP jsr-82 application that connects to air simulator server

---
java -Dbluecove.stack=emulator -cp microemulator.jar;bluecove-#version#.jar;bluecove-emu-#version#.jar org.microemu.app.Main btApp.jad
---

* Emulator in Unit tests

    Emulator has been designed to be used during unit test to help in automation of tests for JSR-82 applications.

    For unit tests air simulator server can be started as in process server. {{{apidocs/com/intel/bluetooth/EmulatorTestsHelper.html#startInProcessServer()}EmulatorTestsHelper.startInProcessServer()}}

    Documentation for BlueCove API that enables the use of Multiple Adapters and Bluetooth Stacks in parallel in the same JVM can be found {{{../bluecove/apidocs/com/intel/bluetooth/BlueCoveImpl.html#useThreadLocalBluetoothStack()}here}}.

    Complete JUnit test example can be found here {{{xref-test/net/sf/bluecove/ExampleTest.html}ExampleTest}}

* Configuration options

    System properties:

        * `bluecove.stack=emulator` force BlueCove to use Emulator instead of real Bluetooth stack

        * `bluecove.deviceID=1` bluecove supports multiple local devices, this will force it to select second one.

        * `bluecove.deviceAddress=btaddr` select local devices by Bluetooth address

        * `bluecove.emu.rmiRegistryHost=localhost` air simulator server can be on remote computer

        * `bluecove.emu.rmiRegistryPort=8090` air simulator server listen on different port. Use 0 on the client to enable in process server (no rmi)

        * `bluecove.emu.rmiRegistry=true` air simulator server and RMI registry can be started inside client JVM

    Emulator Configuration properties:

        This is the resource file 'bluecove.emulator.properties' loaded by air simulator server.
        Defines devices address and names assignment.
        It also can define LocalDevice properties returned to the client application.
