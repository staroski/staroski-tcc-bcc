AvetanaBluetooth - Implementation of the JSR82 specification
from the Sun Microsystems Company using BlueZ

README FILE
=======================================================

This archive contains the sources and the binaries files of the AvetanaBluetooth
project.

VERSION of the AvetanaBluetooth package: 1.0-BETA 

This number means that the project is still a pre-beta version (not all features
are fuly implemented and some features were not fully tested)
But a lot of features are already available. 
For more details, please read the PDF file included.

If you make any usefull modification to any of these project files or if you find some bugs,
do not hesitate to contact us: if the requests and/or the patches are relevant, we will
be happy to include them in the future versions of the project.

The C-source code file was compiled with gcc 3.3 on a Debian Linux system using the libc6 
standard librairy. 
If the version of gcc and/or libc installed on your computer differs from these version numbers,
a re-compilation of the C file may be inevitable. In this case, just go to the directory containing the C 
files (for example the  ~/AvetanaBluetooth/sources/c directory).
You must edit the Makefile file and change the path of the java home directory (that means
that you must set the value of the variable JDK_HOME).

Then, run the command:
$make

You must include the new generated libjbluez.so into the JAR file. Therefore go to the directory
where the binaries files named AvetanaBluetooth.jar and libjbluez.so are stored and run the command
$jar uvf AvetanaBluetooth.jar libjbluez.so

A class named de.avetana.bluetooth.JSRTest demonstrates the use of most JSR82 features. 
But if your not familiar with this specification, we highly recommend to read some related documentation. 
Good tutorials can be easily found on the internet.
