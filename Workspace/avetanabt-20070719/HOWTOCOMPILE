1. Compilation and installation
For your convenience you can find pre-compiled binaries of avetana bt stack in the binaries dir.
Should you need to compile the project please follow the instructions below. Otherwise, enjoy your JSR-82 implementation and have fun..:)

In order to compile the avetanaBT libraries you need following software packages to be installed:
	- Linux Bluetooth protocol stack (BlueZ)
	- GCC compiler
	- Java Developer's Kit Version 1.4.x or higher
	- GNU autotools (autoconf 2.57 or higher)

The compilation procesure assumes that the following environment variables have been previously set:
	- JDK_HOME: this variable should contain the full-path to the installed Java Developer's Kit (e.g., /opt/j2sdk1.4.2_07);
	- JDK_PLATFORM: this variable should contain the symbolic name of the installed Java Platform (i.e., the name of the folder in $JDK_HOME/include containing platform-specific header files required by the Java Native Interface)
	- BIN_DIR: the target directory for the produced binaries (i.e., libavetanaBT.so and avetanaBT.jar).
	
These variables can be set also by editing the envvariables script, contained into the root directory, in order to adapt its content to the specific settings of the target machine.

Upon these preliminary steps, the library can be compiled (and installed in the $BIN_DIR directory) by running the install script as follows:
./install

Install automatically searches for all the required components and packages, and builds avetanabt binaries.

Please notice that the old C Makefiles and header files are still present with a*.old extension.
