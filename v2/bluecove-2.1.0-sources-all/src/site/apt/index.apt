BlueCove

    BlueCove is a Java library for Bluetooth (JSR-82 implementation) that currently interfaces with the Mac OS X, WIDCOMM, BlueSoleil and Microsoft Bluetooth stack found in Windows XP SP2 or Windows Vista
    and WIDCOMM and Microsoft Bluetooth stack on Windows Mobile.

    {{{./bluecove-gpl}BlueCove-GPL}} is additional GPL licensed module to support BlueCove runtime on Linux BlueZ.

    {{{./bluecove-emu}BlueCove JSR-82 Emulator module}} is additional module for BlueCove to simulate Bluetooth stack.

    BlueCove can be used in Java Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.1 or newer.

    BlueCove has been tested on following JVM:

    * {{{http://harmony.apache.org/}Apache Harmony - Open Source Java SE}} 5.0M5 on Win XP 32 bit

    * SUN Java 1.1.8 on Windows XP/X86

    * SUN Java 2 Platform Standard Edition 1.4.2 on Windows XP/X86

    BlueCove provides JSR-82 Java interface for following Bluetooth Profiles:

    * SDAP - Service Discovery Application Profile

    * RFCOMM - Serial Cable Emulation Protocol

    * L2CAP - Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol

    * OBEX - Generic Object Exchange Profile (GOEP) profile on top of RFCOMM and TCP

* BlueCove Tests

    You can help us to make BlueCove better or understand how we are testing it look {{{bluecove-examples/bluecove-tester}here}}.

    JSR 82 TCK test results {{{tck/index.html}here}}.

* BlueCove examples

    * BlueCove OBEX Push J2ME application installer {{{bluecove-examples/obex-install}here}}.

    * MIDlet application {{{http://www.mgmaps.com/}Mobile GMaps}} created by Cristian Streng will connect to GPS receiver over bluetooth. <<<{{{bluecove-examples/bluecove-webstart/open/wap.mgmaps.com/mgmaps.jnlp}\u00bbStart now}}>>>.

 BlueCove provides an implementation of the JSR 82. Applications should use {{{bluecove/apidocs/index.html}API defined in JSR-82}}.
You may find many examples on the {{{http://www.google.com/search?q=JSR+82+tutorial}internet}} describing the usage of JSR 82.

 We created short (50 lines of code each) examples for you to get started with JSR-82 application development:

    * {{{bluecove/apidocs/overview-summary.html#ServicesSearch}Services Search}}
